# Set up mutt to use our local maildir:
set mbox_type = Maildir
set folder = /var/mail/glabs/
set spoolfile = "+dev/INBOX"  # This is your 'primary inbox'

color normal default default

# I manually manage the mailbox command so that my mailboxes come up
# in the order I want.
mailboxes +dev #="acc2/acc2" ="acc1/acc1.folder1" # ... Keep going with more. 

# One very useful feature are folder hooks which change
# options depending on the folder you are viewing:

# for instance you could do
folder-hook dev set from="Glabsounet<Glabsounet@gmail.com>"

#folder-hook dev set sendmail="msmtp-enqueue.sh -a acc1";
